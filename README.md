# Dockerfiles

This repository contains a bunch of [Dockerfiles](http://research.axelquack.de/virtualization/2014/08/30/dockerContainerVirtualization.html), which are specifications of container images for [Docker](http://research.axelquack.de/virtualization/2014/08/30/dockerContainerVirtualization.html). Each folder has a separate READ ME file with installation instructions.  
Feel free to contribute or let me know if there are any issues.

For the most part, all these container images are published under my username on the Docker registry, at: [https://index.docker.io/u/guttertec/](https://index.docker.io/u/guttertec/)
